By using data obtained from weather stations around the island an analysis was able to provide the client with the information they needed to pitch their business plan. Specifically focusing on data from June and December to insure year round success, also during peak tourist months.

## Summary
As expected June is hotter than December however compared to the majority of the United States 71 degrees is still surfing weather. For the tourists 71 degrees is also still ice cream weather and with a maximum temperature of 83 degrees it is still ice cream weatehr for the locals. Additional queries that were preformed for analysis were on the preciptaion of both months. Since it is Hawai'i it is important to also look at the amount of rain a location recieves due to the fact it was be a hot day and still be raining which is not ideal for surfing or ice cream.
